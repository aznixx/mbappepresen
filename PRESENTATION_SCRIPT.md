## Slide 1: Intro (KYLIAN - THE PHENOMENON)
**(Start with a strong, engaging opening. Do not rush.)**

"Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to talk about a talent that emerges only once in a generation. Someone who didn't just join the world of football, but completely redefined what is possible on the pitch. 

From the concrete courts of Bondy to the glittering summit of the world stage, his journey is a testament to raw speed, surgical precision, and unwavering ambition. He is not just a player; he is a force of nature. This is the story of Kylian Mbappé."

## Slide 2: Origins (BONDY)
**(Transition to the next slide. Tone becomes more grounded and nostalgic.)**

"It all began here. Born in 1998, mere months after France's historic first World Cup victory, it was as if he was destined for greatness from his very first breath. 

He was raised in the vibrant suburbs of Bondy. In this place, football is more than just a sport to pass the time—it is a language, a culture, and a way of life. It was on these streets that the dream began to take shape."

## Slide 3: Breakout (MONACO)
**(Pick up the pace slightly to match the energy of his breakout.)**

"At just 18 years old, the world took notice. He didn't just step onto the scene; he tore through Europe's elite defenses with a fearless agility that we hadn't seen in years.

Leading AS Monaco to a stunning Ligue 1 title against all odds and orchestrating a Champions League run that shocked the giants of Europe, he loudly announced his arrival on the global stage. The boy from Bondy had arrived."

---

## Slide 4: King (PARIS)
**(Tone should be majestic and proud.)**

"But destiny called him home. Returning to Paris not just as a player, but as a hero, he embraced the massive weight of expectation. 

Over seven historic years, he became Paris Saint-Germain's all-time top scorer. He embodied the soul of the city, etching his name permanently into the fabric of Parisian history. He was the King of the Park."

---

## Slide 5: World Champion (2018)
**(A moment of triumph. Speak with awe.)**

"And then, the world stage. Four goals. One golden trophy. A performance for the ages. 

Becoming only the second teenager in history—after Pelé himself—to score in a World Cup Final, he joined the pantheon of greats at just 19 years old. The entire world watched in awe as a new king was crowned in Russia."

---

## Slide 6: Warrior (2022)
**(Tone shifts to intensity and resilience. This is the climax of the story.)**

"Fast forward to 2022. A historic hat-trick in the greatest final ever played. He single-handedly dragged his nation to the very brink of immortality. It was a display of dominance that proved he stands alone at the absolute peak of the game. Even in defeat, he was the victor in the eyes of the world."

---

## Slide 7: The Hattrick (Cinematic Video)
**(Allow the video to play for a few seconds before speaking. Let the visuals do the work, then emphasize the miracle.)**

"Three goals. One relentless warrior. In a breathtaking 97-second window, he dragged France back from the dead, defying probability and logic.

It was a performance that transcended sport, proving that even at the summit of the world, his will to win is unmatched."

## Slide 8: Brotherhood (SQUAD)
**(Tone relaxes. A warmer, more personal vibe.)**

"But behind the superstar is the man. Football is temporary, but the bond with the streets is forever. 

Whether tearing up the pitch with icons or cruising through the neighborhood with his day ones, he never forgets where he came from. Loyalty, family, and roots—these are the foundations of his success."

---

## Slide 9: Future (MADRID)
**(Look forward with excitement.)**

"And now, the next chapter begins. Fulfilling a childhood destiny clad in iconic white. 

He chases the only trophy that remains elusive, ready to conquer new heights and solidify his legacy as the greatest of all time in the hallowed halls of the Bernabéu. The Galactico era has returned."

---

## Slide 10: Legacy (The Trophy Cabinet)
**(Final concluding thought. Leave the audience with a lasting impression.)**

"At just 25, his trophy cabinet already rivals the most decorated legends of the game. A World Cup winner, a serial domestic champion, and the undisputed heir to the footballing throne. 

Yet, with his prime still ahead, the scariest part for his opponents—and the most exciting part for us—is that the best is yet to come. History is being written before our eyes."

**(Thank the audience.)**
